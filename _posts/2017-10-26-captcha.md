title: Vicarious's Generative Model of Vision
category: AGI

A lot of hard work and time went into our Science paper released today: ["A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/10/26/science.aag2612). I feel fortunate to work on such incredible research, and be listed as a coauthor! Check out our blog post ["Common Sense, Cortex, and CAPTCHA"](https://www.vicarious.com/2017/10/26/common-sense-cortex-and-captcha/).
