I presented ["Predictive Analytics with Numenta Machine Intelligence"](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Data-Science/events/232031072/) for a meetup with the SF Data Science group. There was some great Q&A and discussion with everyone who came out! **Check out my [slides here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1_XUjaAXeV3SXJ5ZG1DcHJGZG8/view?usp=sharing).**
