## About

What are the properties underlying intelligence, how does this manifest in neural computation, and how can we build machines based on these principles? At the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience, I study and build theoretical and computational models of neuronal processing towards general AI.

I'm a Senior Research Engineer with <a href="http://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/dileep-george-vicarious-ai-work/" target="_blank">Vicarious</a>, where we're building human-level AI.

What else am I up to? I'm a runner, a yogi, a traveler. I love music, just not country. My bookshelf is a diverse set from DF Wallace and Heinlein, to Brian Greene and Tim Maudlin.

I was recently selected to the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2016/01/04/30-under-30-in-science-
