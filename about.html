## About

I'm a software engineer specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a background in computational mechanics and spacecraft engineering. I'm currently a Senior Research Engineer with <a href="http://www.vicarious.com/" target="_blank">Vicarious</a>, where we're working to build human-level AI.

What else am I up to? I'm also a runner, a yogi, a traveler. I love music, just not country. My bookshelf is a diverse set from DF Wallace and Heinlein, to Brian Greene and Tim Maudlin.

I was recently selected to the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2016/01/04/30-under-30-in-science-
