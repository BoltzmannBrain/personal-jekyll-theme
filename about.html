## About

What are the properties underlying intelligence?
How do these manifest in neural computation?
And how can we build software based on these principles?
At the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience, I build probabilistic machine learning systems with neural-inspiration, in pursuit of general AI.

After a few years developing human-level AI for robotics with <a href="http://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/dileep-george-vicarious-ai-work/" target="_blank">Vicarious</a>, I'm moving on to pursue the emerging paradigm of <a href="http://www.probabilistic-programming.org/" target="_blank">probabilistic programming</a>. Stay tuned!

What else am I up to? I'm a runner, a yogi, a traveler, a concertgoer. My bookshelf spreads the gamut from DF Wallace and Heinlein, to Brian Greene and Tim Maudlin.

I'll occasionally blog (below), but check me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/theAlexLavin" target="_blank">@theAlexLavin</a> for more recent ramblings.
