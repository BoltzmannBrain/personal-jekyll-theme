## About

What are the properties underlying intelligence?
How do these manifest in neural computation? 
And how can we build machines based on these principles? 
At the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience, I study and build theoretical and computational models of neuronal processing towards general AI.

I'm a Senior Research Engineer with <a href="http://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/dileep-george-vicarious-ai-work/" target="_blank">Vicarious</a>, where we're building human-level AI for robotics applications.

I was selected to the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2016/01/04/30-under-30-in-science-
exploring-new-worlds-in-the-stars-and-in-our-cells/#732a25964f2f" target="_blank">Forbes 30 Under 30 list for Science</a>!

What else am I up to? I'm a runner, a yogi, a traveler, a concertgoer. My bookshelf spreads the gamut from DF Wallace and Heinlein, to Brian Greene and Tim Maudlin.

I'll occasionally blog (below), but check me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/theAlexLavin" target="_blank">@theAlexLavin</a> for more recent ramblings.
