I graduated from UCLA in 2013 with a major in Mathematics/Economics and a minor in Spanish.
<br><br>
studied computational mechanics and worked on a <a href='https://twitter.com/astrobotic/status/561239211756773378' target='_blank'>lunar rover</a>"
<br><br>
I also cofounded Green the Greek at UCLA, an organization devoted to increasing ecological awareness and promoting sustainability in all Greek houses on the UCLA campus.
